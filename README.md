# MinorProject
Minor Project work carried out from month of August to December '16. 
This project explores the standardization of electronic health records and tries to explore various resources to determine the most robust, scalable and simplified standard for deploying  digitisation of health records. We examined the potential of the  new Health Level 7 (HL7) standard Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources(FHIR), a standard to help achieve healthcare systems interoperability. With comprehensive testing of FHIR and complete exploration of its features (especially for mental health records). This study provides a chronicle of the evolution of the HL7 messaging standards(comparison with version2 version 3), an introduction to HL7 FHIR, deployment of a fully functional FHIR server and exploring the behavioural health profile in FHIR. With this study, we also explored the major potential that FHIR  as a standard  can provide in fields of a unification of global healthcare system and data mining for further technological exploration.
